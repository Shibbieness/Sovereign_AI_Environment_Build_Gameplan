# Sovereign AI Environment

**Status:** INITIAL
**Document Type:** README
**Scope:** Master Orientation Document

---

## Overview

The Sovereign AI Environment is a locally sovereign, architecturally layered AI operating framework designed to support autonomous, extensible, and secure AI execution. It is built as part of the broader Eidos System ecosystem and progresses from philosophical foundation to engineering-grade implementation.

This README serves as the primary entry point into the documentation corpus.

---

## Documentation Structure

The system is defined across four primary canonical documents:

### 1. Canvas Codex — Sovereign Local AI Operating Environment
**Role:** Foundational Architecture  
Defines philosophy, architectural layers, sovereignty principles, and system capability scope.

### 2. Canvas Codex — Local Autonomous AI Stack & Strategic Positioning
**Role:** Implementation + Strategic Layer  
Provides practical local deployment guidance and ecosystem positioning strategy.

### 3. Canvas Codex — Phase I Engineering Specification
**Role:** Engineering Specification  
Transitions the architecture into structured scaffolding, formal specification, and threat modeling.

### 4. Canvas Codex — Phase I EExpansion & Formalization
**Role:** Implementation-Ready Foundation  
Includes concrete Rust scaffolding, RFC-grade `.saipkg` specification, filesystem intelligence engine design, IDE wireframes, and documentation governance framework.

## Architectural Model

The Sovereign AI Environment is layered and modular. Core conceptual layers include:

- Hardware / Host Layer
- Runtime Layer
- Model Orchestration Layer
- Filesystem Intelligence Layer
- Package Management Layer (`.saipkg`)
- Security & Integrity Layer
- IDE / Interface Layer

Each layer is independently evolvable while maintaining cross-layer integrity.

---

## Package Format

The `.saipkg` format is defined under RFC-SAI-0001.

It provides:
- Deterministic packaging
- Manifest-based validation
- Integrity verification
- Dependency modeling
- Executable capability descriptors

---

## Security Model

Security is addressed using a STRIDE-based threat modeling approach:

- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

Mitigations are integrated at architectural and package levels.

---

## Relationship to Eidos System

The Sovereign AI Environment operates within the broader Eidos System ecosystem and is designed for subsystem integration, architectural cohesion, and long-term extensibility.

---

## Project Goals

1. Local sovereignty
2. Deterministic builds
3. Formalized specifications
4. Implementation-ready scaffolding
5. Security by design
6. Modular extensibility
7. Governance-grade documentation

---

## Governance Rules

- Documentation is living and additive.
- Corrections are preserved via strikethrough and annotation.
- Specifications are hardened toward publishable standards.
- Architecture must remain layered and modular.

---

## Current Phase

Phase I — Formalization & Foundational Build

The project is currently positioned at engineering-grade specification and early implementation scaffolding.

---

## Entry Points

For architecture: Start with the Sovereign Local AI Operating Environment document.  
For implementation: Begin with the Phase I Engineering Specification.  
For code scaffolding and package standards: Use the Phase I EExpansion & Formalization document.
