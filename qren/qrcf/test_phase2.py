QRCF Phase 2 — test suite.

Covers `qrcf_types_phase2.py` and `qrcf_circle_rules.py`: ~83 KB and 28
top-level definitions that shipped, imported cleanly, and were reachable by
nothing and covered by nothing. They were referenced only in a docstring.

Writing this immediately found a defect that had been latent since the package
restructure: `is_crystal_valid` and `verify_ice_contract` both did
`from qrcf_types import EdgeType` — the absolute form — and raised
ModuleNotFoundError on every call. Nobody noticed, because calling them was
not something anything did.

That is the argument for this file. Code that is never run is not dormant, it
is unverified: it looks like a capability in an inventory and behaves like a
gap when reached for.

Run:  python -m qren.qrcf.test_phase2
